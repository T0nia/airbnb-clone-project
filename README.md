# UI/UX Design Planning

The aim of this design is to achieve a simple but lovely UI/UX that allows users to perform basic functionalities.

## Design goals and the key features to be implemented

**Goals:**
- **Property Listing View:** A page displaying various property listings with essential details and images.
- **Listing Detailed View:** A detailed view of a specific property, including more extensive information and images.
- **Simple Checkout View:** A streamlined process for booking properties.
- **Search Functionality:** A robust search feature enabling users to find properties based on criteria like location, price, and availability.

**Features:**
- **Property Listings:** Display properties with relevant details and images.
- **Booking System:** Allow users to book properties, view booking details, and manage bookings.
- **Search Functionality:** Enable users to search for properties based on various criteria (location, price, availability).
- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration for users.

## Descriptions of the three primary pages:

| Pages | Name | Description |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Property Listing View | This is the main interface of the AirBnB clone. It shows a clean and modern layout with various property listings displayed, each with a title, price, and a brief description. The design focuses on user-friendly navigation and visual appeal. |
| 2 | Listing Detailed View | This page illustrates a detailed view of a specific property listing within the AirBnB clone. It highlights key features such as the property’s name, location, price, and additional details like amenities. The interface emphasizes clarity and ease of use for potential renters. |
| 3 | Simple Checkout View | This page showcases the booking or reservation process for the selected property in the AirBnB clone. It may include options for selecting dates, the number of guests, and finalizing the booking. The design is streamlined to ensure a smooth user experience. |

## The importance of a user-friendly design in a booking system

A user-friendly design is very important for any booking system. This is because users will need to navigate around different options before making a decision on the exact suite to book, so they should be able to navigate freely without getting frustrated by a complicated user interface. It also helps users to make decisions quicker and speaks well of the business. 

## A list for all color styles, Typography (front family, font weight, font size)

**Colors styles:**
- Main background: #FFFFFF;
- Primary color: #34967C;
- Footer color: #222222;

**Typography:**
- Font-family: Source Sans Pro;
- Font-size: 94px;
- Font-weight: 600;

## The importance of identifying design properties of a mock up design
It is very important to identify and document the properties of a mock up because it ensures design consistency accross all platforms and pages that the users will be viewing. It also makes communication easier between the designers and developers, so there will be no misinterpretations of certain properties in the design. With consistency and clear comminication in place, the website/app will be developed faster with reusable components.
