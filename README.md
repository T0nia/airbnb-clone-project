# **The importance of a user-friendly design in a booking system**

A user-friendly design is very important for any booking system. This is because users will need to navigate around different options before making a decision on the exact suite to book, so they should be able to navigate freely without getting frustrated by a complicated user interface. It also helps users to make decisions quicker and speaks well of the business.
